# Rick and Morty API

This was a group project. We had 5 days to create a website where users can browse the characters and planets exisiting in the popular TV show, Rick and Morty.
In the starter repo we had some custom hooks we did not write.

Design and layout of the page was fully my part in the development.

In the development we used:

**Rick and Morty API**

**React.js**

**Material-UI**

**Adobe Illustrator**
